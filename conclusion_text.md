## Three Specific Takeaways

### A. First Takeaway

Through the winning percentage of other countries in the history of the FIFA World Cup, we can see which countries are good at soccer and how many have won. We found that Brazil has the highest winning percentage and has almost 70 percent winning percentage in World Cup history. Also, Tunisia has the lowest winning percentage and has about 13 percent winning percentage. This does not necessarily mean that the country is good at soccer, but we can anticipate from this data whether a country is good at soccer or not since it is already competitive to earn a seat in FIFA World Cup. Meanwhile, it is a analysis of cumulative data so some data are data from Finals, and some are from Semi-Finals. The data from Final rounds and Semi-Final rounds can tell more than matches played in other rounds. Thus, there should not be a directly clear correlation between the winning percentage and the overall

### B. Second Takeaway

We discovered that 1705 games were played in entire World Cup history. The first World Cup has started in 1930 and lasted until 2018, which was held in various countries for 88 years, although some World Cups were not held in 1942 and 1946 due to World War II. Except 2018 World Cup, the cumulative attendance in World Cup is 37457647 people. This means that the popularity of the World Cup is enormous and that many people are interested.

### C. Third Takeaway

We found something very interesting during our World Cup research. We were curious about how many goals each side scored in a single World Cup match. We found the highest number of goals by combining the home and away team, 12 goals.
